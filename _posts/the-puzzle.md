The Puzzle
==========

A product must have an application in mind to succeed.

It seams like an obvious thing but I have seen so many projects fail for not heeding that command. At this point I think I will digress into alagory to express my opion.

Imagine a jigsaw Puzzle each piece is built to fit into one location. the piece has registaion marks or features on each side that fit with the peices it is suposed to fit in with.

& perhaps I should just go back to the Puzzle model
- describe mold making
  - what are registaion marks
# background for the mental model 
When I was young my [grandpa had a bronze foundry][1]. 
I spent some time at the foundry and learned a bit about the casting process there.
For now we will be descussing the mold making process.
like with many things there are many ways to make molds and techniques are nuanced and complex but we will just descuss the brush on and shell process.
- an original model is made
- the molder desides how the finished prodcut will be removed from the mold.
- the molder adds registaion features to the mold along any seams creating a multi part mold.
- the molder paints silicone onto the mold.
- plaster is added on top to create a rigid stuture to hold up the silicone
- the mold is removed from the original mold

# just tell me why I should care
When you are you making a mold you are making it to form an object. The mold is not the end goal the thing that comes out of the mold is. This is alot like software the goal is to truly understand a problem  

- use a Puzzle analigy for
software is like creating a single puzzle piece that needs to fit into any puzzle that you want it to.
puzzles have features on there sides to make sure that they only fit into one place. When you are creating a software project this is also true. Every feature you create puts a little shape on your product. When someone looks at the product. 

# what are we building
What is the core functinality
 - the mold

- puzzle peices have registaion marks or features
  - this makes them fit in the correct place
- only add features where you want registaion

# caviots
- people are fexible
- code is fexible
